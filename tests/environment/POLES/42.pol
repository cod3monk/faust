nagios(127.0.0.1) # The notation for IPs can the same as below (see in rules
                  # section)
# For documentation about macro names and arguments see lib/macros.py

# The second block are the rules from the network to the router
# the block must always start with IN: on a seperate line, followed by the 
# rules
IN:
# any rule has the following format:
# action protocol src [src-port] dest [dest-port] [extentsion]
# action: may be permit or deny
# protocol: may be one of: ip, tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ahp
# source: may be one or a semicolon-delimited combination of the following:
#       IPv4:
#         123.123.123.123  - normal ip notation
#         123.123.123.1-3  - will match 123.123.123.1, 123.123.123.2 and 
#                            123.123.123.3
#         123.123.123.1,3  - will match 123.123.123.1 an 123.123.123.3
#         123.123.123.0/24 - is equivilant to 123.123.123.0-255, may be other 
#                             size than /24
#         123.123.123.*    - is equivilant to 123.123.123.0/24, * may only be 
#                            in the last octet
#
#       IPv6 (may not be used in combination with IPv4):
#         2001:638:a00:4f:21f:f3ff:fe50:b3d3  - normal IPv6 notation
#         2001:638:a00:4f:21f:f3ff:123.56.7.8 - IPv6+IPv4 notation
#         2001:638:a00:4f::1                  - short IPv6 notation
#         2001:638:a00:4f::/23                - Network notation
#         1:2::1-3                            - matches 1:2::1, 1:2::2, 1:2::3
#         1:2::1,5                            - matches 1:2::1 and 1:2::5
#         1:2::1-3,4                          - matches 1:2::1 to 1::2::4
#      Additional names may be used (not in combination with the above):
#         local            - always matches to the local net
#         any              - matches everything, equivilant to 0.0.0.0/0
#         any other names starting with $ are replaced according to settings in hosts.ini
#         
#         these names may have a [4] or [6] suffix restricting the match to
#         ipv4 or ipv6
#
# source-port: may be a number (23), a range (23-42) or a comma-delimited 
#              combination (23,40,42-64)
# destination: same as source
# destination-port: same as source-port
# extension: may be one or a comma-delimited combination of the following:
#            established, log, echo, echo-reply

# Some examples:
permit ip local any
permit ip 10.0.0.0/24 any
# again the same
permit ip 10.0.0.0-255 any
# or
permit ip 10.0.0.1,2,3,4,5,6-255 any
# or
permit ip 10.0.0.1-3;10.0.0.4;10.0.0.5-255 any
deny ip any any
